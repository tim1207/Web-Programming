# Responsive Web Design

Try to finish the following design requirements by modifying HTML and SCSS files:

1. Set the width of the `.container` element in different window sizes:
   When the width of the window is less than or equal to 600px, set width of `.container` to 100%.
   When the width of the window is between 601px and 1000px, set width of `.container` to 600px.
   When the width of the window is greater than 1000px, set width of `.container` to 1000px.

2. Set the width of the `.column` elements in different window sizes:
   When the width of the window is less than or equal to 600px, set width of `.column` to 25%.
   When the width of the window is between 601px and 1000px, set width of `.column` to 50%.
