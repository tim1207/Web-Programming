# Navigation Bar Design

Try to finish the following design requirements by modifying HTML, SCSS and JavaScript files:

1. Update the position mode of the `.navbar` element to `fixed`, and fixed to the upper left corner of the viewport.

2. Set the display of the `.navbar` to flex, and use the `justify-content` property of `.navbar` element to align the `.navbar-brand` element to the left, and make `.navbar-list` to the right.

## Settings for the mobile version of the website ( max-width <= 900px ):

3. Set the position mode of the `.navbar-list` element to `fixed`. then set the width to `200px`, and `100vh` for height property.

4. Hide the `.navbar-list` from the screen through the relevant properties of CSS Position(top, left, bottom, right).

5. Import `jquery.js` and `./javascript/main.js` to `index.html`.
hint: you will be able to find `jquery` on `https://cdnjs.com/`.

6. Use jQuery to bind the click event of `.navbar-toggler`. After the event occurs, use the toggleClass function to switch the class of `.navbar-list` element and change the position to display `.navbar-list` on the screen.
