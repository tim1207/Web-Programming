# Bootstrap effects

1. Integrate the `Collapse` effect of Bootstrap 4 to the elements with `id="article1"` and `id="article2"` in the HTML file, and make `article1` be displayed on the screen by default.

2. Integrate the `Tab` effect of Bootstrap 4 to the elements with `id="article3"`, `id="article4"`, `id="article5"` in the HTML file, and make `article3` be displayed on the screen by default.
(You may need to use `.tab-content` and `.tab-pane` class.)

3. Create a `Carousel` Component of Bootstrap 4 in `section2` to display the images from `./images` folder.
